###Dcor RAD workflow notes & documentation

Working through Dcor RAD data from February, using Mike's 'workflow', then play around with other downstream applications

Start with two files-one F one R (one lane)
-upstream, check file sizes, lines (should be same between F and R), other QC checks-see Mike's PDF
1. Run 'run_BestRadSplit.sh'-calls for BarcodeSplitListBestRadPairedEnd.pl (so also need that loaded)
  - set arguments in command line for input F and R and the prefix you want it to add to all the files (open perl script for details)
2. Index BWA with Green turtle reference genome
3. Align PE reads to reference using BWA
  -see RAD_bwa.sh
